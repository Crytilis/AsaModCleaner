# ASA Mod Cleaner

**ASA Mod Cleaner** is a powerful tool designed for players of **ARK: Survival Ascended** on the PC/Steam platform. The tool provides a convenient way to manage all mods that have been installed, including those installed automatically using the **Cosmetic Dynamic Downloading** feature. With ASA Mod Cleaner, players can easily clean up their mods, keep their game environment organized, and disable cosmetic downloading when needed.

## Features

- **Automatic Retrieval of ARK Installation Directory**: 
  ASA Mod Cleaner utilizes **SteamWorks.NET** to communicate with the Steam client, automatically locating the ARK: Survival Ascended installation directory for seamless configuration.

- **Clean Up Dynamic Mods**: 
  Easily uninstall mods installed via ARK's **Cosmetic Dynamic Downloading** feature, which otherwise may be difficult to identify and remove.

- **Selective Mod Removal**: 
  Choose to **remove all mods** or **selectively uninstall specific mods** from your game, allowing you more control over your mod setup.

- **Disable Cosmetic Dynamic Downloading (Upcoming Feature)**: 
  ASA Mod Cleaner will include a feature to **disable dynamic cosmetic downloading** directly through the app. This will provide users with a convenient way to turn off unwanted mod downloads.

- **User-Friendly Installation Options**: 
  Installation of ASA Mod Cleaner is available through either a **zip file** or an **installer (ASAMC_Setup.exe)**. Note that **.NET 8 Desktop runtime** is required to use the application.

- **Safe Game Management**: 
  After uninstalling mods, there is **no need to restart the game**. Instead, simply **exit to the main menu** and reconnect to your server or single-player instance. The tool also ensures that ARK is not running before performing certain operations, like disabling dynamic downloads.

## How It Works

ARK: Survival Ascended's **Cosmetic Dynamic Downloading** can automatically install mods as players connect to servers. Unfortunately, ARK doesn't always display which mods were downloaded, making it hard to clean up afterwards. **ASA Mod Cleaner** solves this problem by:

1. **Disabling Cosmetic Dynamic Downloading** (via an in-game setting or soon directly from the app).
2. Allowing users to **uninstall mods** that were installed dynamically.
3. **Selective Cleaning** to remove only specific mods or a full clean to remove all downloaded mods.

## Usage Instructions

1. **Install ASA Mod Cleaner** via the **zip file** or the **installer (ASAMC_Setup.exe)**.
2. Make sure you have **.NET 8 Desktop runtime** installed.
3. **Launch ASA Mod Cleaner**, and it will automatically detect your ARK installation directory.
4. Choose whether to **clean all mods** or **select the mods** you want to remove.
5. After uninstalling mods, **exit to the main menu** and reconnect to your server or single-player instance—there is no need to fully restart the game.

### Important Note
- The **Cosmetic Dynamic Downloading disabling feature** is currently on the roadmap. When available, ASA Mod Cleaner will ensure that ARK is **not running** before performing this operation.

## Requirements
- **.NET 8 Desktop Runtime** is required.

## Installation

## Roadmap
- **Disable Cosmetic Dynamic Downloading Directly**: Implementing the ability to disable the dynamic downloading feature directly within the application.
